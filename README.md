Here’s a general structure for what you can include in your README.md file for your GitHub project, particularly for the CGPA Calculator you’re working on:

CGPA Calculator

Description

This project is a C++ program that calculates the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of a student. The program accepts grades inputted by the user, converts them into grade points, and calculates the GPA for a semester based on the number of courses and corresponding grades.

Features

	•	Grade conversion: Converts letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) into grade points.
	•	GPA Calculation: Computes the GPA based on user input for grades and course credit values.
	•	Supports multiple courses: Allows input for multiple courses to calculate the CGPA.

How to Use

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/CGPA-Calculator.git


	2.	Compile the program:
Using g++, you can compile the task1.cpp file:

g++ task1.cpp -o cgpa_calculator


	3.	Run the program:

./cgpa_calculator


	4.	Input:
	•	The program will prompt you to enter grades for each course.
	•	It will convert the letter grades into grade points and calculate your CGPA.

Example

Enter number of courses: 5
Enter grade for course 1: A
Enter grade for course 2: B
Enter grade for course 3: C
Enter grade for course 4: A
Enter grade for course 5: B

Your CGPA is: 3.4
